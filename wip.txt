Stuff to work on with QIX

- Shapes only fill away from QIX location
  - Defect on some cases filling over the monster
x Shapes should use area fill to close
. Shape fills happen when touching a wall
. Shapes should calculate area
. Player should be able to move on borders of drawn shapes
. Player doesn't look correct, should be a diamond shape
  - Maybe
. Player can change speed for drawing
x QIX Monster doesn't move correctly, needs face/movement algorithm
x QIX Monster trails are too close and mirror direction vs a 'tail'
x QIX Monster doesn't bounce off walls
. QIX Monster doesn't kill player if touched
. Need a title area on field
  - lives
  - area
  - time
  - level
  - score
. Size of playfield should be a param (default to 640x480)
  - Maybe not, but perhaps a zoom?  Or aspect change?
. Player animations
  - start
  - explode
  - complete
. Sparks on higher levels (post level 3)
. Multiple QIX Monsters (level 3 on)
. Sounds
